Amazing Grass,Sports & Energy Drinks,"Our whole leaf cereal grasses are organically grown and harvested only once a year allowing the root system to grow deep and capture an abundance of rich nutrients and minerals not typically found in traditional green leafy vegetables. We harvest at peak nutrition and cut only the tips of the grass where the nutrition is concentrated. While we don’t get the same yield as other crops, we ensure the highest quality grasses are whole leaf, not juiced, maintaining the nutritious fiber and whole food nutritional properties other grasses lack, ensuring mother nature’s available. Our organic cereal best is in every scoop. The result, one scoop is the nutritional equivalent of more than 10 shots of tray-grown wheat grass. At Amazing Grass our roots run deep...Back to our family farm in Kansas, where for over 3 generations Amazing Grass has organically grown & harvested the most nutrient-dense greens on earth. Today, we thoughtfully craft our greens with the highest quality, plant-based ingredients curated from like-minded farmers from around the world. Amazing Grass products are a delicious way to nourish your body with the whole food nutrition it needs to feel amazing every day.","Important information
