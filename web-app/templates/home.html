  <h3>How should you position your products to stay competitive? </h3><br>

  With the rise of online grocery shopping, it has become more important than ever for brands to choose the right pricing and seo strategies to stay competitive. Unlike Brick and mortar grocery stores, where brands can rent out better shelf spaces to position their products in the best locations, online stores are all about seo optimization, and competitive pricing. Even though it is cheaper to sell products online, the winning brands are the ones who utilize data efficiently to show up on the top of the search ahead of their competitors.

  Consumer Packaged Goods companies spend a lot of money buying data from third party institutions such as IRI and Nielson when a lot of the data collected are already publicly available.

  The goal of this website is to help small business owners who are trying to enter the highly saturated CPG market, research the top keywords and the best pricing practices to stay competitive and grow their brands outreach.

  This website has used the Target, Whole Foods, Amazon and Bristol Farms' websites to scrape thru their products, and gather all of the information available about every single item. The total number of rows for the dataset is 13615 and the prices are for the 90048 zipcode in Los Angeles, CA. <br><br>
